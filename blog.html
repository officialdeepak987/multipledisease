                    Heart disease is a general term that includes many types of heart problems.
                    It's also called cardiovascular disease, which means heart and blood vessel disease.
                    Heart disease is the leading cause of death in the United States,
                    but there are ways to prevent and manage many types of heart disease.

                        Heart disease symptoms depend on the type of heart disease.
                        <br>

                        Symptoms of heart disease in the blood vessels
                        Coronary artery disease is a common heart condition that affects the major blood vessels
                        that supply the heart muscle. Cholesterol deposits (plaques) in the heart arteries are
                        usually the cause of coronary artery disease. The buildup of these plaques is called
                        atherosclerosis (ath-ur-o-skluh-ROE-sis). Atherosclerosis reduces blood flow to the heart
                        and other parts of the body. It can lead to a heart attack, chest pain (angina) or stroke.
                        <br>

                        Coronary artery disease symptoms may be different for men and women. For instance, men are
                        more likely to have chest pain. Women are more likely to have other symptoms along with
                        chest discomfort, such as shortness of breath, nausea and extreme fatigue.

                        Chest pain, chest tightness, chest pressure and chest discomfort (angina)
                        Shortness of breath
                        Pain in the neck, jaw, throat, upper belly area or back
                        Pain, numbness, weakness or coldness in the legs or arms if the blood vessels in those body
                        areas are narrowed
                        You might not be diagnosed with coronary artery disease until you have a heart attack,
                        angina, stroke or heart failure. It's important to watch for heart symptoms and discuss
                        concerns with your health care provider. Heart (cardiovascular) disease can sometimes be
                        found early with regular health checkups.

                <p class="blog-desc">

                    With diabetes, your body either doesn't make enough insulin or can't use it as well as it
                    should. Diabetes is a chronic (long-lasting) health condition that affects how your body turns
                    food into energy. Your body breaks down most of the food you eat into sugar (glucose) and
                    releases it into your bloodstream.

                        Diabetes mellitus refers to a group of diseases that affect how the body uses blood sugar
                        (glucose). Glucose is an important source of energy for the cells that make up the muscles
                        and tissues. It's also the brain's main source of fuel.

                        The main cause of diabetes varies by type. But no matter what type of diabetes you have, it
                        can lead to excess sugar in the blood. Too much sugar in the blood can lead to serious
                        health problems.

                        Chronic diabetes conditions include type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes. Potentially
                        reversible diabetes conditions include prediabetes and gestational diabetes. Prediabetes
                        happens when blood sugar levels are higher than normal. But the blood sugar levels aren't
                        high enough to be called diabetes. And prediabetes can lead to diabetes unless steps are
                        taken to prevent it. Gestational diabetes happens during pregnancy. But it may go away after
                        the baby is born.

                        Coronary artery disease symptoms may be different for men and women. For instance, men are
                        more likely to have chest pain. Women are more likely to have other symptoms along with
                        chest discomfort, such as shortness of breath, nausea and extreme fatigue.

                        Diabetes is a chronic disease that occurs either when the pancreas does not produce enough
                        insulin or when the body cannot effectively use the insulin it produces. Insulin is a
                        hormone that regulates blood glucose. Hyperglycaemia, also called raised blood glucose or
                        raised blood sugar, is a common effect of uncontrolled diabetes and over time leads to
                        serious damage to many of the body's systems, especially the nerves and blood vessels.

                        In 2014, 8.5% of adults aged 18 years and older had diabetes. In 2019, diabetes was the
                        direct cause of 1.5 million deaths and 48% of all deaths due to diabetes occurred before the
                        age of 70 years. Another 460 000 kidney disease deaths were caused by diabetes, and raised
                        blood glucose causes around 20% of cardiovascular deaths (1).

                        Between 2000 and 2019, there was a 3% increase in age-standardized mortality rates from
                        diabetes. In lower-middle-income countries, the mortality rate due to diabetes increased
                        13%.

                        By contrast, the probability of dying from any one of the four main noncommunicable diseases
                        (cardiovascular diseases, cancer, chronic respiratory diseases or diabetes) between the ages
                        of 30 and 70 decreased by 22% globally between 2000 and 2019.

                        Key facts
                        The number of people with diabetes rose from 108 million in 1980 to 422 million in 2014.
                        Prevalence has been rising more rapidly in low- and middle-income countries than in
                        high-income countries.
                        Diabetes is a major cause of blindness, kidney failure, heart attacks, stroke and lower limb
                        amputation.
                        Between 2000 and 2019, there was a 3% increase in diabetes mortality rates by age.
                        In 2019, diabetes and kidney disease due to diabetes caused an estimated 2 million deaths.
                        A healthy diet, regular physical activity, maintaining a normal body weight and avoiding
                        tobacco use are ways to prevent or delay the onset of type 2 diabetes.
                        Diabetes can be treated and its consequences avoided or delayed with diet, physical
                        activity, medication and regular screening and treatment for complications.
                        Overview
                        Diabetes is a chronic disease that occurs either when the pancreas does not produce enough
                        insulin or when the body cannot effectively use the insulin it produces. Insulin is a

                        Symptoms
                        Symptoms of diabetes may occur suddenly. In type 2 diabetes, the symptoms can be mild and
                        may take many years to be noticed.

                        Symptoms of diabetes include:

                        feeling very thirsty
                        needing to urinate more often than usual
                        blurred vision
                        feeling tired
                        losing weight unintentionally
                        Over time, diabetes can damage blood vessels in the heart, eyes, and kidneys and nerves.

                        People with diabetes have a higher risk of health problems including heart attack, stroke
                        and kidney failure.

                        Diabetes can cause permanent vision loss by damaging blood vessels in the eyes.

                        Many people with diabetes develop problems with their feet from nerve damage and poor blood
                        flow. This can cause foot ulcers and may lead to amputation.

                        Type 1 diabetes

                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Type 1 diabetes (previously known as insulin-dependent, juvenile or childhood-onset) is
                        characterized by deficient insulin production and requires daily administration of insulin.
                        In 2017 there were 9 million people with type 1 diabetes; the majority of them live in
                        high-income countries. Neither its cause nor the means to prevent it are known.

                        <br>
                        Type 2 diabetes affects how your body uses sugar (glucose) for energy. It stops the body
                        from using insulin properly, which can lead to high levels of blood sugar if not treated.

                        Over time, type 2 diabetes can cause serious damage to the body, especially nerves and blood
                        vessels.

                        Type 2 diabetes is often preventable. Factors that contribute to developing type 2 diabetes
                        include being overweight, not getting enough exercise, and genetics.

                        Early diagnosis is important to prevent the worst effects of type 2 diabetes. The best way
                        to detect diabetes early is to get regular check-ups and blood tests with a healthcare
                        provider.

                        Symptoms of type 2 diabetes can be mild. They may take several years to be noticed. Symptoms
                        may be similar to those of type 1 diabetes but are often less marked. As a result, the
                        disease may be diagnosed several years after onset, after complications have already arisen.

                        More than 95% of people with diabetes have type 2 diabetes. Type 2 diabetes was formerly
                        called non-insulin dependent, or adult onset. Until recently, this type of diabetes was seen
                        only in adults but it is now also occurring increasingly frequently in children.

                    Parkinson's disease is a brain disorder that causes unintended or uncontrollable movements, such
                    as shaking, stiffness, and difficulty with balance and coordination. Symptoms usually begin
                    gradually and worsen over time. As the disease progresses, people may have difficulty walking
                    and talking.

                        Parkinson's disease signs and symptoms can be different for everyone. Early signs may be
                        mild and go unnoticed. Symptoms often begin on one side of the body and usually remain worse
                        on that side, even after symptoms begin to affect the limbs on both sides.

                        Parkinson's signs and symptoms may include:

                        Tremor. A tremor, or rhythmic shaking, usually begins in a limb, often your hand or fingers.
                        You may rub your thumb and forefinger back and forth. This is known as a pill-rolling
                        tremor. Your hand may tremble when it's at rest. The shaking may decrease when you are
                        performing tasks.
                        Slowed movement (bradykinesia). Over time, Parkinson's disease may slow your movement,
                        making simple tasks difficult and time-consuming. Your steps may become shorter when you
                        walk. It may be difficult to get out of a chair. You may drag or shuffle your feet as you
                        try to walk.
                        Rigid muscles. Muscle stiffness may occur in any part of your body. The stiff muscles can be
                        painful and limit your range of motion.
                        Impaired posture and balance. Your posture may become stooped. Or you may fall or have
                        balance problems as a result of Parkinson's disease.
                        Loss of automatic movements. You may have a decreased ability to perform unconscious
                        movements, including blinking, smiling or swinging your arms when you walk.
                        Speech changes. You may speak softly, quickly, slur or hesitate before talking. Your speech
                        may be more of a monotone rather than have the usual speech patterns.
                        Writing changes. It may become hard to write, and your writing may appear small.

                        Coronary artery disease symptoms may be different for men and women. For instance, men are
                        more likely to have chest pain. Women are more likely to have other symptoms along with
                        chest discomfort, such as shortness of breath, nausea and extreme fatigue.

                        Causes
                        In Parkinson's disease, certain nerve cells (neurons) in the brain gradually break down or
                        die. Many of the symptoms are due to a loss of neurons that produce a chemical messenger in
                        your brain called dopamine. When dopamine levels decrease, it causes atypical brain
                        activity, leading to impaired movement and other symptoms of Parkinson's disease.

                        The cause of Parkinson's disease is unknown, but several factors appear to play a role,
                        including:

                        Genes. Researchers have identified specific genetic changes that can cause Parkinson's
                        disease. But these are uncommon except in rare cases with many family members affected by
                        Parkinson's disease.

                        However, certain gene variations appear to increase the risk of Parkinson's disease but with
                        a relatively small risk of Parkinson's disease for each of these genetic markers.

                        Environmental triggers. Exposure to certain toxins or environmental factors may increase the
                        risk of later Parkinson's disease, but the risk is small.
                        Researchers have also noted that many changes occur in the brains of people with Parkinson's
                        disease, although it's not clear why these changes occur. These changes include:

                        The presence of Lewy bodies. Clumps of specific substances within brain cells are
                        microscopic markers of Parkinson's disease. These are called Lewy bodies, and researchers
                        believe these Lewy bodies hold an important clue to the cause of Parkinson's disease.
                        Alpha-synuclein found within Lewy bodies. Although many substances are found within Lewy
                        bodies, scientists believe an important one is the natural and widespread protein called
                        alpha-synuclein (a-synuclein). It's found in all Lewy bodies in a clumped form that cells
                        can't break down. This is currently an important focus among Parkinson's disease
                        researchers.

                        Risk factors
                        Risk factors for Parkinson's disease include:

                        Age. Young adults rarely experience Parkinson's disease. It ordinarily begins in middle or
                        late life, and the risk increases with age. People usually develop the disease around age 60
                        or older. If a young person does have Parkinson's disease, genetic counseling might be
                        helpful in making family planning decisions. Work, social situations and medication side
                        effects are also different from those of an older person with Parkinson's disease and
                        require special considerations.
                        Heredity. Having a close relative with Parkinson's disease increases the chances that you'll
                        develop the disease. However, your risks are still small unless you have many relatives in
                        your family with Parkinson's disease.
                        Sex. Men are more likely to develop Parkinson's disease than women.
                        Exposure to toxins. Ongoing exposure to herbicides and pesticides may slightly increase your
                        risk of Parkinson's disease
